Download Github code and Dataverse data. This parent directory should contain two unzipped subfolders after unzipping: cone-disk-packings-main (from Github) and dataverse_files (from Dataverse)

Only the parent directories need to be unzipped; files within these directories do not need to be unzipped. The dataset and any included analysis intermediates can be analyzed without unzipping.
